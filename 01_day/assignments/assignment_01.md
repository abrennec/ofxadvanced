# Assignments 1

This sheet contains several questions to have you recap what you already know about C++ as well as to have you research things that you have not heard of yet. Feel free to use the Internet for research. Good sources are listed on the introduction page of this course.


## Recap and Research 

### 1 What is the difference between declaration and definition?

### 2 Is there a difference between an object, class and type?

### 3 What is a function argument, what is a function parameter?

### 4 What is meant by auto deduction and what might be an advantage?

### 5 What is a virtual function? 

### 6 What is meant by adding "= 0" to a virtual function like "virtual void myFunc() = 0" ?

### 7 What does the "static" keyword mean in the context of member functions?

### 8 What is the general idea of a "template" in C++?
