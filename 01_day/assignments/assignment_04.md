# Assignments 4

## Create a Software Synthesizer Prototype

- The synthesizer should provide at least two different types of sound wave shapes and it should be possible to extend them with more wave types easily. 
- The synthesizer should support user interaction. 
- The synthesizer should be independent from ofApp so that you might be able to easily re-use your code with a different SDK.

### 1 Conceive a simple software synthesizer 

### 2 Refactor the ofApp following your design
