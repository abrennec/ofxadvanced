# Assignments 2

## Explore the Code

### 1 Review the first ofApp example and understand class.

### 2 Check out the audioOut() function. How is it implemented and what is happening there?

- Comment things out and back in again to get an understanding of the waves

### 3 Play around with the different sine and pulse waves to your liking. 

- For example
  - Generate different sine waves using different pulse waves, for example
  - Play with adding and removing pulse waves to develop some kind of "beat"
  - Change the frequency, phase, etc.
  - Create a underlying beat by simpling using one wave at low frequency with a fast pulsewave
