# Day 2: Mapping Sound to Graphical Objects

The second day of the workshop will be dedicated to connecting your synthesizer to graphical objects. Therefore, we will explore a classical "bouncing balls" example as a starting point for further development. You will check out generic stl containers and create a user-driven visual synth.

## Reviewing the Code



## Bouncing Balls Concept



## Applying your Synth to Bouncing Balls

- scales (major, minor)


## Performance Aspects

- object creation
- slider to adjust number of objects
- copying data, audio input ?


## Generic Containers



## Further Thoughts on Expanding the ofApp 

Check out the coding example "shader_frequency". This might as well be an interesting approach that uses shader programming to visualize your sound. 

How could you make use of audioIn in this context?
