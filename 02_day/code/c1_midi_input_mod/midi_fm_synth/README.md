# ofxATK

ofxATK (Audio Tool Kit) is an audio digital signal processing library made specifically for openFrameworks. The goal of ofxATK is not to be the most efficient library or cover the broadest scope. Rather, it is designed to be intuitive and pedagogical. The comments not only contain information about code functionality, but contain information about the sonic practices as well. In addition to the well documented code, two youtube channels exist and are ongoing. openFrameworks Audio Programming Tutorials covers the creation of new DSP classes that will be added to ofxATK, and ofxATK Projects documents and explains the use of this library in practice. 

Tested on Windows and MacOS, should work on Linux.

update: do to an issue with portSF, windows will only compile in 32bit. This issue should be resolved mid-February 2018.
