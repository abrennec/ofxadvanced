This is example of image filtering, which uses ofxOpenCv addon.
It thresholds original image,
and also smooths and thresolds original image.
You can see that smooth+threshold gives binary image with smooth boundaries,
which is easies for further analyzing.

Images on the screen:
[Original image]	[Thresholded original image]
[Smoothed image]	[Thresholded smoothed image]

--------------------------------------
How to make openFrameworks project:
- Use Project generator for creating an empty project with linked ofxOpenCv addon.
- Copy this sources to src folder of the project.
- Copy copy image sunflower.png into bin/data folder of the project.
--------------------------------------

It's the example 02-ImageFiltering from the book 
"Mastering openFrameworks: Creative Coding Demystified",
Chapter 9 - Computer Vision with OpenCV
