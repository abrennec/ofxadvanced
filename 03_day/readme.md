# Day 3: Driving Sound with Images

The third day of the workshop will be dedicated to finalizing the implementation of the syntheszier. Moreover, we will aim for connecting visuals to the sound engine. We will start with a classical "bouncing balls" example and explore image data as an input source for driving the sound generators. 


## Practice: Code Review

Before we start working on further features of the synthesizer, we will start with a code review session. Review the previously developed prototype and identify one or two aspects of your implementation that you would like to show and review with the group. Consider aspects where you felt stuck as well as aspects where you found a good solution. 

## Bouncing Balls Concept

## Applying your Synth to Bouncing Balls

- scales (major, minor)

## Performance Aspects

- object creation
- slider to adjust number of objects
- copying data, audio input ?

## Generic Containers


## Using Images as Input Data

- parameters
- reading input, ofPixel, ofImage

## ofApp: System Driven Melodies

- major, minor scales
- trigger bouncing balls based on image data
- blend bouncing balls with images
- ... ?


## ofx

- ofxPDSP
  - data to wave example
- image to sound

- flow distort
